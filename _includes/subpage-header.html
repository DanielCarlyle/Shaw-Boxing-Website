                        <p class="animated fadeInDown">From its debut in 1986, Shaw Boxing has remained one of the most
                            popular and talked-about networking and fundraising events in Toronto’s business community.
                        </p>
                        <p class="animated fadeInDown">
                            Shaw Boxing offers a night of camaraderie, first class hospitality and professional boxing
                            matches. Guests enjoy exceptional cuisine and high-quality sporting action close to their
                            table,
                            along with networking with the who’s who from the ranks of Canada’s top 100 companies.</p>

                        <p class="animated fadeInDown">
                            On May 9, 2019, we will celebrate the 34th anniversary of this phenomenal event, which has
                            raised over $11 million in support of the Shaw Festival Theatre, Canada. Proceeds have
                            helped to
                            build one of the largest and most prestigious acting ensembles in North America, and develop
                            programs that foster actors, designers and directors who in turn play their part in theatre
                            companies across Canada.</p>
